# Data Science Competition- Social Media Prediction

### Team Name - Student Baseline

### Team Members:

Balaji Balasubramanian

Patcharin Cheng 

Arjun Vaithilingam Sudhakar

### Prerequisite:

1.  Make sure the dataset is linked under the following directory/load the competition dataset in Kaggle,

/kaggle/input/ift6758-a20/...
or, The data path file has been written to run it on Kaggle notebooks, rename the path file if required.

2. The codes require pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost, mlxtend-0.18.0, os, random, and warnings libraries to run.

Please update mlxtend to the latest version(0.18.0) before running it.(Kaggle notebook uses mlxtend-0.18.0 by default, hence no need to update here).

### Steps to run the program:

Step 1: change input directories to point at your files

Step 2: run `python script.py`

Step 3: A csv file will be generated (model prediction on the test data after training)

Step 4: Upload the csv file created under Submit Prediction in Kaggle to get the accuracy score to estimate the model generalized performance

### This notebook will generate the score as following:

Public Score = 1.70724

Private Score = 1.59018
